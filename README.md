# Nearest Vehicle Positions
In the link below you will find a binary data file which contains a position for each of 2 million vehicles. Your task is to write a program that can find the nearest vehicle position in the data file to each of the 10 co-ordinates provided below. In addition to being able to do this, however, your program must be able to complete all 10 lookups in less time than our benchmark. This benchmark is based on simply looping through each of the 2 million positions and keeping the closest to each given co-ordinate. This is simply repeated for each of the 10 provided co-ordinates.



The challenge set to you is to think of a more efficient way to achieve this and to implement it.

The structure of the binary data file is as follows:

Field

Data Type

PositionId

Int32

VehicleRegistration

Null Terminated ASCII String

Latitude

Float (4 byte floating-point number)

Longitude

Float (4 byte floating-point number)

RecordedTimeUTC

UInt64 (number of seconds since Epoch)


The 10 co-ordinates to find the closed vehicle positions to are as follows Position 1 Latitude = 34.544909 Longitude = -102.100843

Position 2

Latitude = 32.345544

Longitude = -99.123124





Position 3

Latitude = 33.234235

Longitude = -100.214124





Position 4

Latitude = 35.195739

Longitude = -95.348899





Position 5

Latitude = 31.895839

Longitude = -97.789573





Position 6

Latitude = 32.895839

Longitude = -101.789573





Position 7

Latitude = 34.115839

Longitude = -100.225732





Position 8

Latitude = 32.335839

Longitude = -99.992232





Position 9

Latitude = 33.535339

Longitude = -94.792232





Position 10

Latitude = 32.234235

Longitude = -100.222222
